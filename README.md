# Travel - Blog WebSite

A travel blog website i built using MERN - `MongoDB, Express, React, Node.Js` . 

To run the site on the computer locally using the command line:

### `cd Api folder`

Cd to Api folder and run `npm install` to install all the necessary files.

### `cd Client folder`
Cd to Client folder and run `npm install` to install all the necessary files. 

### `npm start`
Run the `npm start` command, first from the Api folder and then from the Client folder.


### `That's All!`

* Now you can see previous posts that uploaded to the web site,

* You can register to the site and add your own posts,

* You can filter to watch posts by category,

* And you can filter to watch posts by username,

* You can also edit your personal details and add your personal photo.

**I would like to receive some comments and suggestions for improvement :)**
